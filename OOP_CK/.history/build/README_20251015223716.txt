OOP_CK Distribution

Included files:
- app.jar             (runnable JAR)
- installer/          (native Windows installer created by jpackage)

How to run the JAR:
1. Make sure Java is installed (JRE 17+ recommended).
2. Open PowerShell in this folder and run:
   java -jar app.jar

How to install using the EXE (Windows):
1. Open the `installer` folder.
2. Double-click the EXE (e.g., OOP_CK-1.0.exe) and follow the installer steps.

Notes:
- The JAR is a portable option; the installer produces a desktop/start-menu shortcut depending on installer defaults.
- If you want a custom icon or MSI package, provide an .ico file or request MSI and I'll rebuild.
